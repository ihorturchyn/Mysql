#Initial data: Mysql version 8.0.19 for Linux Alpine

#At first we need to add some changes into /etc/mysql/my.cnf config file at Master server:
server-id=1                                           
default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password    #to turn off cashing_sha2_password, which was implemented with Mysql 8.0 release.
log-bin=/var/lib/mysql/mysql/mysql-bin.log             #path to binary log
bonlog-do-db=<replicated_DB>                           #name of database, which you want to replicate.

#Then we need to restart Mysql service:
/etc/init.d/mysql restart

#then we need to create new user at master server for replication:
mysql -u<user> -p<password>
create user 'slave_user'@'ip:port' identified with mysql_native_password by 'password';     #if you want to define slave_user with any IPs - you should use '%'
grant replication slave on *.* to 'slave_user'@'ip:port';   #if you want to grant replication rights on certain db/table - you should use "...on *dbname.tablename"
flush privileges;

#then we need to lock all tables and make mysqldump of replicated_DB:
use <>replicated_DB>;
flush tables with read lock;
mysqldump -u<user> -p<password> <replicated_DB> > replicated_DB.sql
unlock tables;

#then we need to check master status:
show master status;
#in output you will see mysql binaty file and his position. This file will be used by slave for reading changes.
#Exanple: mysql-bin.000001, position - 157.

#then we need to reconfig slave server:
#at first we need to create database with name of <replicated_DB>. Name is same as it is created at Master.
create database <replicated_DB>;
#then we need to load mysqldump from Master server
mysql -u<user> -p<password> <replicated_DB> < <replicated_DB>.sql

#then we need to add some changes to /etc/mysql/my.cnf config file of slave server:
server-id=2
relay-log=/var/lib/mysql/mysql/mysql-relay-bin.log
log-bin=/var/lib/mysql/mysql/mysql-bin.log
binlog-do-db=<replicated_DB>

#then we need to run replication at slave server:
CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='ip of master', MASTER_USER='slave_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='password',MASTER_LOG_FILE = 'mysql-bin.000001', MASTER_LOG_POS = 157;
start slave;
show slave status\G;  #here, in output, if near field Slave_IO_Running and Slave_SQL_Running you see "Yes" - all your changes were made correctly and replication is working now.
